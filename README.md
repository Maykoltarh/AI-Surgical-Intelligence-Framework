# AI-Assisted Surgical Intelligence Framework

## Overview
This repository introduces a conceptual and clinical framework for the use of Artificial Intelligence as a cognitive assistant in advanced and specialized surgical procedures.

The focus is on **AI-assisted decision-making**, not autonomous surgery, with strict human-in-the-loop control.

---

## Motivation
Modern complex surgeries demand:
- Extreme precision
- Real-time risk awareness
- Cognitive load management for surgeons

Artificial Intelligence can enhance surgical performance by acting as an intelligent assistant that supports perception, prediction, and decision-making without replacing human authority.

---

## Core Concepts
- AI as a **cognitive surgical assistant**
- Real-time computer vision for anatomical awareness
- Predictive risk modeling during surgery
- Human–AI collaborative intelligence
- Ethical and safe AI deployment in the operating room

---

## Framework Architecture
1. **Perception Layer**
   - Surgical computer vision
   - Sensor fusion (video, imaging, signals)

2. **Intelligence Layer**
   - Machine learning models
   - Decision-support algorithms
   - Pattern recognition and anomaly detection

3. **Interaction Layer**
   - Augmented visualization
   - Haptic and visual guidance
   - Surgeon-controlled feedback

---

## Application Domains
- Neurosurgery
- Cardiothoracic surgery
- Oncologic surgery
- Robotic and minimally invasive surgery

---

## Research Status
This repository currently presents a **conceptual framework**.
Future versions may include:
- Simulation models
- Pseudocode
- Experimental implementations
- Clinical validation studies
